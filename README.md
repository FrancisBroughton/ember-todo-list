# ember-todo-list

This todo project is the first attempt with EmberJS.

The Working componants are that you can add and remove items to the list.

I had a few issues getting the completed/incomplete buttons to render items on the list that are ticked when complete or not complete.

The aim is to figure our why the incomplete and complete buttons do not render the correct outcome.
